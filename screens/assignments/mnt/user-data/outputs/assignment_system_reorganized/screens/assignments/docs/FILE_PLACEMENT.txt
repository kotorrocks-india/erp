```

### 2. Install Schema
Open Python console in your project directory:
```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from schemas.assignments_schema import install_assignments_schema
from connection import get_engine

engine = get_engine()
install_assignments_schema(engine)
print("✅ Schema installed successfully!")
```

### 3. Update Navigation
Edit: H:/New Volume (H)/Games/app23/app_weekly_planner.py

Add these lines:
```python
# At the top with other imports
from screens import assignments1

# In your pages dictionary
pages = {
    # ... existing pages ...
    "📝 Assignments": assignments1.render_assignments_page,
}
```

### 4. Test in Browser
```bash
cd "H:/New Volume (H)/Games/app23"
streamlit run app_weekly_planner.py
```

Navigate to "📝 Assignments" from the sidebar.

## 🚦 Verification Steps

### Step 1: Import Test
```python
# Test imports work
from schemas.assignments_schema import install_assignments_schema
from services.assignment_service import AssignmentService
from screens import assignments1

print("✅ All imports successful!")
```

### Step 2: Schema Test
```python
from connection import get_engine
from sqlalchemy import text as sa_text

engine = get_engine()

# Check if tables exist
with engine.begin() as conn:
    result = conn.execute(sa_text("""
        SELECT name FROM sqlite_master 
        WHERE type='table' AND name LIKE 'assignment%'
    """)).fetchall()
    
    print(f"✅ Found {len(result)} assignment tables:")
    for row in result:
        print(f"  - {row[0]}")
```

### Step 3: Service Test
```python
from connection import get_engine
from services.assignment_service import AssignmentService

engine = get_engine()
service = AssignmentService(engine)

# Try listing (should work even if empty)
assignments = service.list_assignments()
print(f"✅ Service working! Found {len(assignments)} assignments")
```

### Step 4: UI Test
1. Run: `streamlit run app_weekly_planner.py`
2. Click "📝 Assignments" in sidebar
3. Should see: Context selector and subject dropdown

## ❗ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Module Not Found
ERROR: "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'schemas.assignments_schema'"
SOLUTION: Check file is in correct location and __init__.py exists in schemas folder

### Issue 2: Import Error
ERROR: "ImportError: cannot import name 'install_assignments_schema'"
SOLUTION: Check assignments_schema.py was copied completely (not truncated)

### Issue 3: Table Already Exists
ERROR: "Table 'assignments' already exists"
SOLUTION: This is OK - schema is idempotent. It won't recreate existing tables.

### Issue 4: Foreign Key Constraint
ERROR: "FOREIGN KEY constraint failed"
SOLUTION: Ensure parent tables exist (subject_offerings, academic_years, degrees)

### Issue 5: Context Not Available
WARNING: "Please select context filters first"
SOLUTION: In main page, select: Degree → Program → Branch → AY → Year → Term
